### 🔧 Phase 1: Foundation & Core Tools (MVP)

**Goals**: Establish brand identity, core functionality, and developer experience

- ✅ Define branding, tone, and mascot (done)
- 🔹 Set up monorepo / multi-package structure (`deducktor`, `duckboard`, etc.)
- 🔹 Create a shared design system / component library (for future UI consistency)
- 🔹 Implement core of `deducktor.data`:
    - File reader/parsers (CSV, Parquet, JSON, Avro, ORC)
    - Profiling engine (null %, unique counts, min/max, etc.)
    - Lightweight frontend visualizer (histogram, pie chart, table preview)
- 🔹 Implement core of `deducktor.sql`:
    - SQL parser + formatter
    - Lineage tracer
    - Unused CTE/join/subquery detector
- 🔹 Publish both as libraries (CLI + API interface)

### 🛠️ Phase 2: Tool Expansion & Integration

**Goals**: Enhance functionality, build other tools, and allow some level of composition

- 🔸 Build `duckboard` MVP:
    - Connect to SQL source
    - Build visual query editor or manual SQL input
    - Render simple charts (bar, line, pie) with filters
- 🔸 Build `conducktor` MVP:
    - DAG YAML config format
    - SQL-based task runner with retries + logging
    - Simple scheduler (cron-like or file-watcher)
- 🔸 Allow all tools to be used both standalone and as Python packages (e.g. `import deducktor.sql`)
- 🔸 Basic CLI for all tools
- 🔸 Package documentation site (docs.deducklabs.com)

---

### 🧠 Phase 3: UX Layer & Deducktive Studio

**Goals**: Centralize the experience, unify UI, and build the “VSCode-for-data”

- 🔹 Launch `deducktive-studio`:
    - Embed deducktor (sql + data) UI
    - Integrate duckboard dashboards
    - Visualize DAGs from conducktor
- 🔹 Provide project/workspace concept (think: folder with SQLs, configs, DAGs)
- 🔹 Offer web-hosted and desktop (Electron?) version

---

### 🧪 Phase 4: Collaboration & CI/CD

**Goals**: Team workflows, versioning, safety

- 🔸 Build `adjuduckcator` MVP:
    - SQL plan, diff, apply tooling
    - Schema/version tracker (possibly Git-based or DuckDB-based)
    - CI/CD GitHub Actions template
- 🔸 Enable shared workspaces (users/team sync)
- 🔸 Git integration for history / blame

---

### 🎮 Phase 5: Education Platform

**Goals**: Community and onboarding for data learners

- 🔹 Build `educkator` MVP:
    - Interactive exercises for SQL, pipeline debugging
    - Mini-problems with hints and test cases
- 🔹 Create boss fights (broken DAG, wrong data type, circular dependency)
- 🔹 Add gamification: XP, badges, progress tracker
- 🔹 Launch leaderboard & certificate engine

---

### 🪄 Phase 6: Polish & Growth

**Goals**: Production-readiness, marketing, and monetization

- 🔸 Design mascot (Detective Duck?) & UI mascot assist
- 🔸 Deploy public demos (interactive playgrounds)
- 🔸 Open source the core (some parts) or offer freemium SaaS
- 🔸 Launch docs, blog, and case studies
- 🔸 Collect feedback, stabilize APIs, and explore enterprise licenses
