### 🔬 **Brand Concept**

**DeDuckLabs** is a playful blend of:
- **“Deduct”** — representing logical reasoning, debugging, and analytical thinking.
- **“Labs”** — symbolizing experimentation, tool-building, and innovation.
- And of course, **ducks** — inspired by the classic _rubber duck debugging_ method.

Why ducks? In software development, rubber duck debugging is a long-standing technique where developers explain their code line-by-line to a rubber duck to uncover bugs or gaps in logic. This quirky but effective practice inspired our mascot and identity. At DeDuckLabs, we bring that spirit into a full suite of tools to help you debug, deduce, and develop smarter.

### 🧩 **Product Family**

Each tool serves a unique need in the modern data stack:

| Tool Name               | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`deducktor`**         | A data profiling and wrangling tool for CSV/Parquet files. Stats like unique counts, min/max, null distribution, standard deviation, and value frequencies. Includes visualizations. This includes a SQL analysis engine. It formats queries, traces lineage, parses stored procedures, and maps dependency graphs from messy SQL files. |
| **`duckboard`**         | A lightweight dashboarding app (PowerBI/Tableau alternative). Data is queried from SQL sources and turned into charts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **`conducktor`**        | A job runner for SQL pipelines. Think Airflow-lite or Dagster-lite focused on scheduled SQL tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **`deducktive-studio`** | A unified web-based UI that combines the above tools for a full data-debugging experience. Think VSCode for data engineers.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **adjuduckcator**       | A CI/CD tool for SQL migrations. Think “Terraform for data” — with `plan`, `apply`, and `diff` for SQL schema and logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### 🎓 **Learning: `educkator`**
A gamified, interactive learning tool to teach SQL, data engineering pipelines, and practical data debugging. Users learn by _doing_, solving real-world problems in a fun way.

Future plans:
- Study plan for data career tracks (e.g. Git, Python, SQL, ETL pipelines, ML fundamentals)
- Boss fights (e.g. fix a broken pipeline with missing dependencies)
- Leaderboards, badges, and certifications

### 🔭 Vision

> Build the **VSCode + Debugger + Playground + Game** for data professionals.

We believe working with data shouldn’t feel like debugging a black box. With the right tools — and a bit of fun — data engineers and analysts can _deduct with clarity, debug with confidence, and develop with delight_.
